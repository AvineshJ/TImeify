Time table generation is tedious job for educationalist with respect to time and man power. Providing a automatic time table generator will help to 
generate time table automatically. Proposed system of our project will help to generate it automatically also helps to save time. It avoids the complexity
of setting and managing Timetable manually. In our project we are going to use algorithms like genetic, heuristic, resource scheduling to reduce these 
difficulties of generating timetable. These algorithms incorporate a numeral of strategy, aimed to improve the operativeness of the search operation. 
The system will take various inputs like number of subjects, teachers, workload of a teacher, semester, priority of subject. By relying on these inputs, 
it will generate possible time tables for working days of the week for teaching faculty. This will integrate by making optimal use of all resources in a way 
that will best suit the constraints
